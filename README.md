## What is it?  
It's a device that can be connected to a PC and pretend to be keyboard and mouse, allowing the user to trigger specific actions using smartphone through wifi or bluetooth.  


## What can you do with it?  
Plug it in to your friend's PC and by pressing a button on your smartphone:
* :satellite: access a website  
* :tv: play a youtube video  
* :capital_abcd: type pre-defined text of your choice  
* :open_file_folder: download and execute file  
* :shipit: [exfiltrate files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBBT1c2zjms) to Dropbox and Gmail  
* :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: move mouse cursor  
* :duck: run ducky script  
* and [much more](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads)  


## Notable features  
* Automatic [OS detection](https://github.com/keyboardio/FingerprintUSBHost), allowing it to work on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
![os logos image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michalmonday/files/master/supremeDuck/resources/repository%20stuff/readme_images/os_logos.png)  
* Built-in presets with funny/weird videos and images.   
* Preview feature, it allows to see what youtube video, wallpaper or website will be launched on the target PC.  
![Preview-feature-gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michalmonday/files/master/supremeDuck/resources/repository%20stuff/preview_option_for_youtube_and_websites.gif)  
* Option to use [alt+numpad](https://github.com/michalmonday/supremeDuck/wiki/MultiLang-method) combinations on Windows (to type correct characters regardless of system language)  
* Language switching to match the language setting on target machine without the need to reprogram the device. Supported settings are:

Edit: Unfortunately Jacks youtube channel got closed (because it had educational hacking videos).   


## Is it going to work on any PC and work instantly?  
It was tested and working well with **Windows 10** :heavy_check_mark:, **Windows 8** :heavy_check_mark:, **Lubuntu 18.10** :heavy_check_mark:, **Ubuntu 18.04** :heavy_check_mark:, straight after pluggin-in. On **macOS 10.12**:zap: it prompted the user to setup the keyboard, after that it worked well, see [macOS setup](https://github.com/michalmonday/supremeDuck/wiki/macOS-setup) for details. It is problematic on **Windows 7**:zap: (driver installation popup takes long time and sometimes requires replugging device, after that it usually works). 

  
## Implementation details  
The smartphone application was made using "MIT App Inventor 2" and is [open source](https://github.com/michalmonday/supremeDuck/blob/master/source/mobile%20app/supremeDuck.aia). Initially it was made with Arduino Pro Micro and HC-06 bluetooth module. Currently it can also be made and used with Esp8266 wi-fi module instead of HC-06 using the same hardware setup spacehuhn used in [wifi_ducky](https://github.com/spacehuhn/wifi_ducky), see the [guide](https://github.com/michalmonday/supremeDuck/wiki/How-to-make-wifi-based-version-(Esp8266)) for more details. It can be also made with JDY-10 and JDY-08 (BLE) modules (more details below).  


## Resources  
- [Application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_michalmonday17.supremeDuck)  
    :warning: As of 08/02/2025, the application is not available on Google Play Store because I failed to verify identity. I'm trying to fix it for the last few months (I uploaded valid documents, sent many emails but dealing with Google Play support is the most dystopian experience I ever had). Not sure if the app will be back on Google Play Store again but the apk is available in the [mobile app](https://github.com/michalmonday/supremeDuck/tree/master/source/mobile%20app) folder (together with the "aia" source file for the App Inventor).

## Future  
According to [MIT App Inventor Team](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/blogs/evan/2018/09/mit.html) it will be possible to run application made using App Inventor on iOS soon which means that the supremeDuck application will not be limited to Android only.  

As of March 2021, it seems that MIT App Inventor application is available for iOS (as mentioned in [this article](https://appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/evan/2021/03/04-mit-app-inventor-ios-app-store)), however there is no way to compile apps for iOS yet. As mentioned [in this post](https://community.appinventor.mit.edu/t/how-to-make-ios-apps-using-mit-app-inventor/28838), it will be possible when MIT finishes testng the iOS compiler.  


## Credits / thanks to / kudos  
:star: [HAK5](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Downloads#duck-encoder) and :star: [mame82](https://github.com/mame82/duckencoder.py) - encoding for different languages used in this project is in 99% based on their work. This project was created thanks to the long chain of people building on top of other people's ideas. If HAK5 did not popularize HID attacks with Rubber Ducky then most of projects like this would not exist. Thanks to :star: authors of ducky scripts posted on [HAK5Darren's page with payloads](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads) this project is richer in features. Thanks to :star: Darren Kitchen for [Dropbox Exfiltration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBBT1c2zjms) and similar videos that all contributed in one way or another to this project.  
:star: [Seytonic](https://maltronics.com/) - in a series of [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJWwKO3_Z0) presented how to use cheap Arduino Pro Micro as "Rubber ducky". It's worth to mention that :star: [Samy Kamkar](https://samy.pl) also presented this kind of functionality [with Teensy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSLEq7-hlmo) in 2014.  
:star: Dejan from howtomechatronics.com - thanks for the tutorials about using Arduino with [bluetooth module](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-and-hc-05-bluetooth-module-tutorial/) and [App inventor](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/how-to-build-custom-android-app-for-your-arduino-project-using-mit-app-inventor/).  
:star: Mr [Jesse Vincent](https://shop.keyboard.io/pages/about-us) who created [FingerprintUSBHost](https://github.com/keyboardio/FingerprintUSBHost) which allows to recognize operating system of the target machine. Noteworthy is that :star: [gloglas](https://github.com/gloglas) used it in [WifiDuckV2](https://github.com/gloglas/WifiDuckV2) (giving me idea to use it too) which is rewrite of :star: [spacehuhns](https://github.com/spacehuhn)'s [wifi_ducky](https://github.com/spacehuhn/wifi_ducky).  
:star: [JackkTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/JackkTutorials/videos) - thanks for presenting this project in a video.  
:star: [Taifun](https://puravidaapps.com/index.php) - thanks for great App Inventor resources and [extensions](https://puravidaapps.com/extensions.php), this project is using few of them.   
:star: Mr [Martyn Currey](http://www.martyncurrey.com/about/) for excellent BLE [tutorial and resources](http://www.martyncurrey.com/arduino-hm-10-and-app-inventor-2/).
